        <h1><b><i>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</i></b></h1>

        <p> I was most inspired by <a href="http://www.bugaboo.com">Bugaboo Strollers</a> and <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en">The Van Gogh Museum</a>. 

        <h1><b><i> How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</i></b></h1>

        <p> Bugaboo uses color, negative space, and columns effectively to highlight the focal point. The negative space uses a huge image of a scene looking at parents watching their child running around and enjoying the outdoors. The boldness of the type on the page with the bold, screaming white against the muted and slightly

unfocused colors of the negative space pops. The focus of the landing page- the red stroller- stands out and I love that it is all of the way to the right, contrasting the action occuring on the opposing side of the screen. The sutble use of columns provides and effective order.
            <br>The Van Gogh Museum's site uses vivid color, negative space, and columns to show the focal point. the bright golden yellow color of the nav areas frame the dominant Van Gogh painting beautifully. The white print draws the eye in. The columns create an interesting spacial relationship.</p>

        <h1><b><i>What makes them similar and different?</i></b></h1>

        <p> Both employ colors and columns to provide contrast and emphasis of the focal point. They also have the negative space featuring an image and text in bold contrast to the colorful images in the background. The navigation is plain. The Van Gogh displays all of it's info and nav immediately, where as the Bugaboo site has most of its nav hidden so you must scroll to find it.

            <li><p><strong>Focal Point:</strong> The focal point for Bugaboo is the red Bugaboo stroller. It is the only color on the page; the parents frame it and the Nav/headline in the middle of the page leads to it.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The most important imformation on the page, the two H1 "strollers" and "about" tell you the essence of the site. The upper nav remains in site while the lower nav is visible once you scroll down.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Balance:</strong> The site achieves balance by having the nav frame the site, the most important nav centered in the page, and the lower nav remain out of sight.</p></li>

            <ul>

            <li><p><strong>Focal Point:</strong> The focal point of this landing page is the painting by Van Gogh. Even though the nav/padding is very bright, the calm colors and texture of his painting captures the attention.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> The message of the site "Meet Vincent" contrasts everything on the site as the white stands out and is centered on the page, regardless of all of the other colors. The whole nav bar is located on the left in desending order of importance and the nav to return to the mainpage remains distinct on the right corner.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Balance:</strong> The texture of Van Gogh's painting and the muted colors dominate the page and balance out the golden yellow nav bars. The use of columns also creates balance, creating proportions that create order to the page.</p></li>
